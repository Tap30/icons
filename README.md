# Tapsi Icon Library

## Overview

The `@tapsi-oss/icons` library is a comprehensive collection of scalable vector graphic (SVG) icons used in the [Tapsi](https://tapsi.ir) design system. This library lets you easily integrate icons into your projects by automatically generating pre-built components from SVG files.

> [!NOTE]
> To add a new icon, simply include the SVG file and its corresponding JSON metadata file in the [icons directory](https://github.com/Tap30/icons/tree/main/icons). There's no need to manually define components or update the documentationâ€”the pre-build process will handle _everything_ for you!
